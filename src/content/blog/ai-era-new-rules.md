Many say AI has changed everything, that the old rules no longer apply. But our observations over the past two years reveal something different: **AI is forcing us to focus on what truly matters**.

## The Great Divergence

Graduates entering the AI era are destined for unprecedented divergence. AI will mercilessly eliminate those who fantasize about coasting on the "prestige" of elite institutions—much like the illusion some parents hold that "getting into Harvard means life is complete." That fantasy is being shattered by AI.

Meanwhile, those with genuine capabilities will no longer need any school or institution to "validate" them.

## The New Wealth Distribution

The future society will birth more billionaires, but there will likely be fewer mega-billionaires worth tens or hundreds of billions. The wave of layoffs at major tech companies, viewed through the lens of history, is actually an accelerator of technological revolution—they've pushed the gear shift of our era with their own hands.

## Looking Forward

It's impossible to imagine what society will look like in 100 years. But looking back at history, just as farmers from a thousand years ago couldn't comprehend today's "virtual labor," we too might find the work patterns of the post-AI world absurd, even nihilistic.

But this isn't frightening. As Duan Yongping once said: *"If this is a new industry that can last 50 years, what does it matter if you enter five years late?"*

**We feel fortunate to be born in this era.**

The convergence of neuroscience, genetics, and artificial intelligence presents unprecedented opportunities to understand and enhance the human mind. At Neuroship, we're committed to harnessing these technologies not to replace human potential, but to unlock it.

The future belongs to those who embrace change while staying grounded in what makes us fundamentally human—our capacity for empathy, creativity, and connection.
